# About Me

I'm a CS Major. This is my last semester before graduating so I've taken quite a few computer classes. I've done some web programming before, mostly with PHP and MySQL. I worked on a website and browser game for the DEC last semester. We used PHP and MySQL for the backend. I also got a little experience working with Javascript and using HTML/CSS from that project. 
I'm hoping the skills I learn in this class will help me get a web development job. Web development seems like it would be a very interesting field to work in. There are so many different problems that can be solved with web applications and the technologies used are always changing. This class will also help me understand how the many web apps I use everyday might work.
